Federal and local law enforcement officials announced a significant firearm seizure in the Capital Region, arresting two Albany brothers, Iziah and Kaya Cox, during Operation Tidal Wave. The operation involved court-authorized searches at over 15 locations, leading to the recovery of 134 firearms, including handguns and high-powered rifles. Iziah Cox faces charges for unlawfully possessing a firearm as a felon, while both brothers are charged with conspiracy to make false statements to financial institutions.

Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, John Sarcone, described the seizure as one of the largest in the district's history. The firearms were discovered in various locations, including 68 in Troy and 25 in Albany, with some concealed in stereo equipment. Four of the recovered weapons were reported stolen, and authorities are tracing all firearms to their origins.

Acting Albany Police Chief Brendan Cox highlighted the community risk posed by the seized firearms, noting that the number of guns recovered in this operation surpassed the total seized by Albany Police in all of 2024. FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig Tremaroli indicated that this seizure is only the beginning of ongoing efforts to address gun violence in the community. The conspiracy charges carry a maximum of five years in prison, while the firearm charge against Iziah Cox could lead to up to 15 years.
