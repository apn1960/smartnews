Headline: Cornell University Extends Spending Cuts and Hiring Freeze Amid Fiscal Pressures

Aug. 22, 2025 â€” Cornell University officials announced that spending cuts and hiring restrictions will continue into the new academic year due to ongoing fiscal pressures. A letter from university leaders attributes these challenges to an "uncertain and unprecedented federal landscape" following the start of President Donald Trump's second term, which has impacted funding for higher education.

The university has faced significant financial strain, including stop-work orders from the federal government affecting research funding, reportedly totaling up to $1 billion. Additionally, Cornell may soon pay $100 million to settle an investigation related to its handling of campus protests over the Gaza conflict and allegations of antisemitism, although officials have not confirmed this settlement.

The letter, signed by President Dr. Michael Kotlikoff and other senior leaders, indicates that the hiring freeze will remain in place indefinitely, with layoffs expected among the university's 11,000 employees. Leaders emphasized the need for urgent cost reductions and a reevaluation of resource allocation, stating that the university is analyzing its budgetary structure to improve efficiency and reduce duplication of work.
