Headline: Waymo Receives Permit for Autonomous Vehicle Testing in NYC

Feb. 21, 2025 - Waymo has received its first permit from the New York Department of Transportation to begin testing autonomous vehicles in New York City, as announced by Mayor Eric Adams. This marks the city's inaugural launch of autonomous vehicle testing, with plans to operate up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn through late September.

The testing will require a driver to be present in the vehicle, in accordance with New York state law. Mayor Adams emphasized the city's commitment to innovation, stating, "New York City is proud to welcome Waymo to test this new technology in Manhattan and Brooklyn," highlighting the importance of safe advancements in urban transportation.

This development follows Waymo's recent expansion efforts across the United States, including new operations in Austin and plans for Atlanta, Miami, and Washington, D.C. The company has surpassed 10 million robotaxi trips as of May and aims to further penetrate the Northeast market. As part of the permit agreement, Waymo will be required to regularly report data to the DOT and collaborate with local law enforcement and emergency services.

Headline: Congressman Denied Access to Immigration Detention Facility

Feb. 21, 2025  
U.S. Rep. Paul Tonko was denied entry to an immigration detention facility in Batavia, New York, this week, despite federal law allowing members of Congress to visit such facilities without prior notice. Tonko aimed to inspect the facility due to concerns regarding residents from his Capital Region district. He highlighted a June report from the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general that noted understaffing in the medical team and improper use of force by guards.

The denial of access is part of a broader trend, with multiple congressional members, including Reps. Dan Goldman and Adriano Espaillat, suing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over similar refusals to allow inspections. Goldman recently faced a similar situation at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn. The lawsuit claims that appropriations bills since 2019 have granted explicit rights for Congress to inspect detention facilities, a right that DHS is accused of obstructing.

DHS officials have stated that a new rule requires a seven-day waiting period for inspections, contradicting the law that exempts members of Congress from such requirements. Tonko expressed concern over the conditions revealed in the inspector general's report, emphasizing the need for oversight and government scrutiny in light of the findings and ongoing immigration enforcement actions.

Headline: New York State Fair Implements Protections for Immigrants

Published date: Oct. 3, 2023. 

New York State officials have established strict protocols to protect undocumented immigrants attending the State Fair, which runs for 13 days. State Fair Director Julie LaFave noted that concerns about potential ICE raids have been discussed during the fair's year-long planning process. The fair's immigration enforcement policy, in place since 2019, aligns with statewide measures regarding ICE agents.

Under the fair's policy, federal immigration authorities must check in at the State Fair Administration Building and present identification along with a judicial warrant before conducting any enforcement actions on the grounds. Governor Kathy Hochul emphasized the importance of these protocols, stating that they are designed to ensure safety for all attendees. 

If an ICE agent fails to comply with the established procedures, LaFave indicated that state police will be alerted. The fair also features various cultural events, including a naturalization ceremony, highlighting its commitment to inclusivity for the New American community.
