Headline: Cornell University Announces Continued Budget Cuts and Hiring Freeze

Feb. 21, 2025 â€” Cornell University officials announced that spending cuts and hiring restrictions will persist into the new academic year due to ongoing fiscal pressures. A letter from university leaders attributes these financial challenges to an "uncertain and unprecedented federal landscape" following the second Trump administration, which has significantly impacted higher education funding.

The university has faced multiple stop-work orders from the federal government affecting its research activities, reportedly amounting to $1 billion. Additionally, Cornell is expected to pay $100 million to settle an investigation related to its handling of campus protests over the Gaza conflict and allegations of antisemitism, although officials have not confirmed this agreement.

The letter emphasizes the need for urgent cost-reduction measures and outlines that the hiring freeze will continue indefinitely, with layoffs anticipated among the university's 11,000 employees. Leaders stated that budget cuts will affect all campuses and that the university is analyzing its budgetary structure to identify efficiencies and reduce redundancy in operations.
