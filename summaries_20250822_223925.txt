Headline: Cornell University Announces Continued Budget Cuts and Hiring Freeze

Aug. 22, 2025 — Cornell University leaders have confirmed that spending cuts and hiring restrictions will persist into the new academic year due to ongoing fiscal pressures. A letter from university officials cites the “uncertain and unprecedented federal landscape” under President Donald Trump’s second term as a significant factor impacting higher education funding.

The university has faced substantial financial challenges, including stop-work orders from the federal government affecting research funding, reportedly totaling up to $1 billion. Additionally, Cornell is expected to pay $100 million to settle an investigation related to its handling of campus protests over the Gaza conflict and allegations of antisemitism, although officials have not confirmed this settlement.

The letter outlines the necessity for urgent cost-reduction measures, indicating that layoffs are likely among the university's 11,000 employees, the largest workforce in Tompkins County. While specific plans for layoffs and a timeline have not been disclosed, the university is analyzing its budgetary structure to enhance efficiency and reduce redundancies in operations.
