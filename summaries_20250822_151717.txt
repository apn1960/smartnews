Headline: State Sen. Peter Oberacker Plans Congressional Run

Feb. 21, 2025  
Republican state Sen. Peter Oberacker is reportedly preparing to run for Congress in New York's 19th Congressional District, potentially leading to the first contested primary in years. This follows consecutive campaigns between Democratic Rep. Josh Riley and former Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro. Oberacker has communicated his intentions to Sullivan County GOP Chair Greg Goldstein, who is now seeking a replacement candidate for Oberacker's current Senate seat.

While Oberacker has not officially announced his candidacy, he acknowledged the encouragement he has received and stated he is seriously considering the run. "I’m humbled by the encouragement I’ve received. After much thought and prayer, I’m giving serious consideration to running and will share my decision soon," he said in a statement. Goldstein expressed hope that local party members would rally behind Oberacker's potential campaign.

Currently, the only other Republican eyeing the 19th District is Haris Alic, a communications staffer who has also not formally declared his candidacy. Both candidates have yet to register with the Federal Elections Commission. The district is viewed as a prime opportunity for Republican gains, as Riley secured the seat with just 51.1% of the vote, while Molinaro previously won it with 50.8% in 2022.
