Headline: Tour Bus Crash in Upstate New York Leaves Multiple Dead and Injured

Feb. 21, 2025  
A tour bus returning from Niagara Falls rolled over on Interstate 90 in Pembroke, New York, on Friday, resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries among the more than 50 passengers. New York State Police reported that the bus lost control for unknown reasons, veered into the median, and ended up in a ditch. Images from the scene depicted the bus on its side, with extensive emergency response efforts underway.

Nearly all passengers sustained injuries, including cuts and bruises, with some individuals trapped or ejected from the bus. The exact number of fatalities has not been confirmed, though police indicated that at least one child was among the deceased. The driver survived the crash and is reportedly in good condition.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul expressed her condolences and stated that her team is coordinating with state and local officials to assist those affected. At least 16 injured passengers were transported to Erie County Medical Center for treatment. All lanes of the thruway at Pembroke were closed, causing significant traffic delays as rescue operations continued.
